# Custom Save and Stay Button for Directus

This interface adds a custom save and stay button avoiding the need to menu dive.

It's a simple (and still hacky) workaround that doesn't rely on keyboard shortcuts.

Just add this custom field to your collection and you're good to go.

## Why is this needed?

Currently there's an open issue that will make "save and stay" the default behaviour for the save button. That issue is marked to be resolved in the next main release of Directus, but until then this is a workaround.
